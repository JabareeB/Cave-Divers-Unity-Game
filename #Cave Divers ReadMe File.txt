Player Control
In "Cave Divers," players control a character called Lucky The Knight navigating through cave levels. Movement is controlled using WASD keys, and J to swing your sword.

Basic Gameplay
Goals/Objectives:

-Navigate Lucky The Knight through cave levels while avoiding and defeating enemies.
-Collect as many coins as possible to increase your score.
-Reach the end of each level to progress to the next, with the ultimate goal of escaping the cave.
-The game begins with a main menu screen featuring Start, Feats, and Quit options. The player wins by reaching the end of the levels, and loses if the health bar depletes to zero, triggering a Game Over screen.

Game Mechanics
-Power-ups: The game features power-ups, including a speed boost, rocket that allows you to use projectiles for 5 seconds and a health power-up.
-Timer: Each level has a 5-minute timer. The user must reach the end within this time to win.
-Lives: Players have a health bar that decreases when hit by enemies or projectiles. The game ends when health is depleted.
Enemies

-Zombie: Rushes at the player, attacking in timed increments.
-Cave Troll (Final Boss): Throws projectiles, rushes, and attacks the player.
